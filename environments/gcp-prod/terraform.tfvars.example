# NOTES FOR GCP TRIAL ACCOUNT
################################################################################
# 1. GCP Free Trial provides $300 credit valid for 90 days
# 2. e2-medium nodes cost approximately $24/month each
# 3. With 2 nodes (system + prod), estimated cost: ~$48/month
# 4. Total cluster lifetime with free credits: ~6 months
#
# To reduce costs:
# - Use e2-small (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM) for ~$13/month per node
# - Use preemptible nodes (up to 80% cheaper, but can be terminated)
# - Use zonal cluster instead of regional (location = "us-central1-a")
#
# Trial account limitations:
# - Maximum 8 vCPUs per region
# - Cannot create more than a certain number of clusters
# - Some regions may not be available
